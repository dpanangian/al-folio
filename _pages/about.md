I am part of [AI4BuildingModeling](https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5297/8940_read-88073/) Group headed by [Dr. Ksenia Bittner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oPr46YIAAAAJ&hl=en). Our group specializes in 3D urban scene reconstruction using satellite imagery.

Unleashing the power of vision generative models for real-world applications is my ninja way. I have been working mainly around inverse problems in imaging but not limited to image-to-image translation, topology-aware and graph-based approaches for building extraction.

Prior to research, I worked on pilot projects at industry-leading companies, developing language models to support internal processes. I earned both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science with a minor in Computational Linguistics from Ludwig Maximilian University Munich.
