I am doing research under [AI4BuildingModeling](https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5297/8940_read-88073/) Group headed by [Dr. Ksenia Bittner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oPr46YIAAAAJ&hl=en). Our group specializes in 3D scene reconstruction using satellite imagery.

My passion is to fuse generative models with prior knowledge to solve real-life challenges. Prior to research, I dedicated my time during both my bachelor's and master's degrees to working in the industry for major corporations, introducing language models to support internal processes.
